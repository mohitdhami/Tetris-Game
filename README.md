## Tetris Game

`Tetris is a classic puzzle video game that was created by Alexey Pajitnov in 1984. In our version, we've incorporated several fundamental features.`

 
- Falling Blocks: The central gameplay element in Tetris involves a continuous stream of geometric shapes (Tetriminos) that fall from the top of the playing field. The player's objective is to manipulate and arrange these falling blocks to create complete horizontal lines without any gaps.

- Rotating Blocks: Players can usually rotate the falling Tetriminos to fit them into the available space and complete lines. Rotation can be done clockwise or counterclockwise, and this feature is essential for strategic play.

- Grid-Based Playfield: The game is typically played on a grid-based playfield, with most versions using a 10x20 grid. The player needs to arrange the Tetriminos within this grid.

- Clearing Lines: When a horizontal line is completely filled with blocks, it is cleared, and the player earns points. Clearing multiple lines at once (referred to as a "Tetris") yields higher scores.

- Game Over: The game ends when the Tetriminos reach the top of the playfield, and the player can no longer place blocks without creating gaps.

- Music and Sound Effects: Many Tetris games have iconic music and sound effects that contribute to the overall gaming experience.
